Personal reference for some common or interesting data structures I see.

### Pre-requisites

- CMake version 3.5
- C++ compiler with at least C++17
- optionally: ninja

### How to build

Option 1:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cmake ..
```

```powershell
C:\project> mkdir build
C:\project> cmake ..
```

Option 2: use build.bat. From where CMakeLists.txt is located, this will create a build directory (GITREPO/build) and generate Ninja build files.
